## 🤖 AI Research Agent
An intelligent research assistant that autonomously conducts research, gathers information from multiple sources, synthesizes findings with confidence scores, and generates a comprehensive research report — all through an intuitive Streamlit UI.

## 🚀 Features
✅ Multi-step research planning (with sub-questions)
✅ Gathers evidence from:

🌐 Web (DuckDuckGo Search)

📚 Academic papers (arXiv, PubMed)

📄 Local documents (PDF, text)
✅ Uses GROQ LLMs (e.g., LLaMA 3.1) for synthesis
✅ Confidence scores (%) for all findings
✅ Executive summary & citations
✅ Outputs a clean, structured report
✅ Streamlit web interface with real-time progress
✅ Exports reports as .txt
✅ Includes automated tests

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
🧠 LangGraph — State machine to orchestrate the research pipeline

🔗 LangChain — LLM integrations & vectorstore interface

💬 GROQ — Free LLMs (e.g., LLaMA 3.1 8b)

🗄️ Zilliz / Milvus — Scalable vector database for chunk storage & retrieval

🌐 DuckDuckGo Search — Web search

📚 arXiv & PubMed — Academic search

📄 Streamlit — User interface

🧪 Pytest — Testing
